        <h2>Broadway through Covid-19: Can the Show Go On?</h2>
        <p>
          In April 2020, amid the global pandemic resulting from the spread of Covid-19, the president of the Broadway League, which represented theatre owners, producers, presenters, and general managers for Broadway and across North America, faced a challenge. On March 12, 2020, Broadway had suspended all plays and musicals. The president and her team needed to determine when Broadway might be able to reopen, what the Broadway League should be communicating to producers and guests, and what the reopening of Broadway would look like amid the global coronavirus pandemic. However, to reach these decisions, she first needed to determine the reliability of the recently released New York State antibody study and estimate the true prevalence of antibodies in the population

        <h2>Glitz Investments: Predicting a Blockbuster</h2>
        <p>
          An investment manager at Glitz Investments, a firm based in the United States with a focus on the entertainment industry, wanted to identify potential blockbuster movies in the Indian film industry for the firm’s potential investment purposes. The investment manager received a report compiled by analysts at the firm indicating that Bollywood would be an attractive industry for investment. The firm’s analysts had collected data but could the manager determine a quantitative relationship between box office performance and the factors the team had identified? Could Glitz Investments choose movies based on this analysis alone? The investment manager's boss was looking for more specific data on which to base the firm’s investment decisions.

        <h2>Asian Grill: Finding the Optimal Table Mix</h2>
        <p>
          In early December 2016, the owner of the Asian Grill restaurant in Henderson, Nevada, noticed that the restaurant had busy nights where customers left due to long wait times, yet there were empty seats due to small groups occupying large tables. She had a proposed new table layout before her and had to evaluate whether this would allow the restaurant to seat more customers on her busiest nights (Thursday to Saturday), or whether a different table layout would be even better.

        <h2>American Idiot: The Value of Billie Joe Armstrong</h2>
        <p>
          In October 2010, Ira Pittelman, lead producer of the Broadway musical American Idiot, had to evaluate one week's grosses from when star musician, Billie Joe Armstrong, was put into the show in New York City. The rock star had been enthusiastic about filling in for an actor in the musical based on an album by his band, Green Day. Audiences had also been enthusiastic, and revenues for the play were up. The producer had to determine whether Armstrong was the source of the increased revenue and, if so, how much his performance had contributed. He needed to determine how to respond should Armstrong offer to act in the musical again. Should he accept such an offer? How much compensation should he offer the star?
